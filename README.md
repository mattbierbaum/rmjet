RMJET
=====

Remove the color map known as 'jet' or 'rainbow' from existing figures. This
utility allows you to directly modify old figures to retroactively change to a
better color map including one sided colormaps ('bone', 'afmhot'), diverging
color maps ('coolwarm'), or qualitative color maps ('cubehelix') while
maintaining and accurate zero point.

What is wrong with jet?
========================

There are several reasons to use a color map that isn't jet. This section will
be expanded later, but for now, I will simply cite this issue on matplotlib's
issue tracker: [replace
jet](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/875)
